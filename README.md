**1)What Server framework did you choose and Why?**

I have choosen Ruby on Rails for following reasons:
-Programmer does not need to worry about configuring files in order to get setup, Rails comes with a set of conventions which help speed up development.
-Ruby on Rails community advocate Agile web development which is an iterative development method, that encourages collaborative and flexible approach.
-It is RESTful application design so it encourages a logical structure within applications, which means they can easily be exposed as an API (Application Programming Interface).
-It handles migrations.

**2)What client side framework did you choose and Why?**

I have choosen JQuery for client side scripting because of following reasons: 
-Easy to execute AJAX request and JSON call.
-Easy to Operate Document Object Modelling(DOM).
-It is Cross Browser Friendly.
-It is free and open source.
-Integration between javascript and JQuery.

**3)What aspects of Implementation did you find easy and Why?**

-Designing of HTML page and mapping css and JQuery in it was easy.

**4)What aspects of Implementation did you find difficult and Why?**

-Understanding of rails framework,deploying application on heroku server,Understanding the git commands and working of each git command was difficult for me initially as i did not work on any web application.

**5)What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?**

-bundle install command installs all API(Application Programming Interface) we need in our application.Other than that,I have not use any other components.
